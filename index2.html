    <h1 class="titeln">JASTOR GALLYWIX</h1>
    <h1 class="wanted">REWARD ($1 MILLION GOLD )</h1>
    <p class="text">
      is the former Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel, one of the most
      powerful goblin trade guilds on Kezan. Despite betraying his own people in
      wake of the Cataclysm in a petty act of vengeance, he retained his
      position as Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel for many years in its
      service to the Horde. Once being a vocal supporter of Garrosh Hellscream,
      he would eventually become one of the last leaders to support the
      Darkspear Rebellion, showing respect for Vol'jin and pledging his loyalty
      to the new Warchief following the Siege of Orgrimmar. Gallywix expresses
      his only desire is to find his people a secure and profitable future,
      which he saw neither of under Hellscream's reign. Gallywix was among those
      present following the Battle for Broken Shore when a dying Vol'jin named
      Sylvanas Windrunner the next Warchief with his dying breath. As the third
      invasion of the Burning Legion reached its end, Gallywix was the first to
      recognize the potential of the Azerite bursting from the planet after
      Sargeras' final attack. Tempting his warchief with the power and profit
      this new resource could bring, Gallywix's greed served as one of the
      impetuses of the renewed Alliance-Horde conflict, profiteering from the
      war. Near the very end of the Fourth War, Sylvanas and Gallywix abandoned
      their people following the rebellion of Varok Saurfang, leaving Thrall to
      promote Gazlowe as his successor.
