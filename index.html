        Grom was young for a chieftain, only a few years older than Durotan and
        Orgrim. There had been mutterings about the mysterious circumstances
        under which the former chieftain had died, but the Warsong clan did not
        challenge Grom's leadership. Upon his ascension to chieftainship, Grom's
        jaw had been ritually tattooed a uniform shade of black. At some point,
        Grom's mate Golka, bore him a son, Garrosh, though the exact date of his
        birth is unknown.After contacting the red pox young Garrosh was sent to
        live in Garadar, and Grom would never see him again.

        Around 11 years BDP,Grommash led aggressive raids deep into ogre lands.
        When the ogres retaliated, they nearly destroyed the Warsong clan. Golka
        was critically injured during the battle and pleaded with him to finish
        her off. Disgusted at her weakness in calling for death instead of
        striving to live, Grom called her "a wolf with no teeth" and walked
        away, leaving her to suffer. He was similarly disgusted by the weakness
        of his other warriors who had "bent like weeds." In truth, however, he
        simply lacked the strength to take the life of the one he loved, and
        this weakness gnawed at his heart for years to come.Grom quickly called
        upon his forces to hunt down the ogre raiders. However, it was a trap
        set by the ogre warlord and Grom was captured. The ogre warlord tried to
        break Grom's spirit by strapping him to a tree and taunting him over the
        course of many days. While his body withered and became emaciated,
        Grom's will never wavered. Declaring that "this wolf still has teeth,"
        he finally bit and killed the ogre warlord when he came too close. Grom
        returned to lead the Warsong clan as "the Warlord with the Iron
        Will.Grom was present at the Kosh'harg celebration in Nagrand. The orcs
        became increasingly aggressive under the secret control of Gul'dan and
        his Shadow Council. They constructed massive arenas where the orcs honed
        their warrior skills in trials of combat and death. During this period,
        a few clan chieftains spoke out against the growing depravity in their
        race. One such chieftain, Durotan of the Frostwolf clan, warned against
        the orcs' losing themselves to hate and fury. His words fell on deaf
        ears.
